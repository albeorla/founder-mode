# Why Founder-Mode Matters

**Explained like you're 16**

---

## The Short Version

Imagine you have a business idea—like "an app that helps people find dog walkers." Before you build anything, you need to know:

- Is this a good idea?
- Are other people already doing this?
- How big is the market?
- What could go wrong?

Normally, figuring this out takes weeks of Googling, reading articles, and writing reports. **Founder-Mode does all of that in minutes.** You type your idea, and AI agents research the internet, analyze what they find, and write you a professional investment report.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Starting a Company is Hard

When someone wants to start a business, they need to do "due diligence"—research to prove the idea is worth pursuing. This usually means:

1. **Hours of searching** - Reading articles, finding statistics, tracking down sources
2. **Making sense of it all** - Organizing random facts into useful insights
3. **Writing it up** - Creating a document that explains the opportunity
4. **Being honest** - Not just finding evidence that supports your idea, but also finding reasons it might fail

Most people skip this step because it's boring and takes forever. Then they waste months (or years) building something nobody wants.

### Building AI Apps is Also Hard

If you're a developer trying to build AI-powered apps, you face a different problem:

Every time you start a new project, you have to set up:
- Configuration files
- Logging systems
- API connections
- Test frameworks
- Error handling

It's like rebuilding your kitchen every time you want to make dinner.

## The Solution

### For Idea Validation

**Founder-Mode turns a one-sentence idea into a 10+ page investment memo.**

```
Input:  "A SaaS platform that helps restaurants reduce food waste"

Output: Professional report with:
        - Market size ($47B global food waste management market)
        - Competitors (Winnow, Leanpath, Too Good To Go)
        - Business model analysis
        - Risk assessment
        - Everything sourced and cited
```

It's like having a team of research analysts working for you, except they work in minutes instead of weeks.

### For Developers

**Founder-Mode is actually a toolkit for building multiple AI apps fast.**

The code is organized so that:
- **80% is shared infrastructure** (the boring stuff every app needs)
- **20% is unique business logic** (the interesting stuff that makes each app different)

This means we can test a new AI app idea in 1-2 weeks instead of months.

## How It Works

Think of it like a team of AI specialists, each with a specific job:

```
YOUR IDEA
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PLANNER                                                    │
│  "What do we need to research to evaluate this idea?"       │
│  Decides: market size, competitors, business model, risks   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  RESEARCHER                                                 │
│  "Let me find the facts."                                   │
│  Searches the web, reads articles, extracts data            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WRITER                                                     │
│  "Here's what it all means."                                │
│  Turns raw facts into a structured analysis                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CRITIC                                                     │
│  "Is this actually good enough?"                            │
│  Reviews the report, rejects it if it's weak                │
│  (Can loop back to PLANNER for more research)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    │
    ▼
YOUR REPORT
```

The **Critic** is the secret sauce. It's an AI that plays devil's advocate—making sure the report isn't just cheerleading your idea but actually analyzing it honestly.

## Why This Matters

### Speed Changes Everything

When research takes weeks:
- People skip it entirely
- They build things nobody wants
- They waste time and money

When research takes minutes:
- You can test 10 ideas in a day
- You find the good ones faster
- You fail cheap instead of expensive

### The Compound Effect

Every improvement to the shared toolkit (agentkit) benefits all future apps. It's like:

- First app: Build the kitchen AND cook dinner (hard)
- Second app: Kitchen exists, just cook dinner (easier)
- Third app: Kitchen is better, cooking is even faster

By the fifth app, we can test a new idea in days.

## Who Is This For?

| Person | How They Use It |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Founders** | Validate ideas before spending money |
| **Investors** | Quick screening of startups |
| **Students** | Learn about market research |
| **Developers** | Build AI apps faster with shared infrastructure |

---

## The Bigger Picture

This is a **one-person AI venture studio**. The goal isn't just one app—it's a system for rapidly testing AI product ideas:

1. **Build apps fast** (1-2 weeks each)
2. **Test with real users** (do they actually want this?)
3. **Double down or kill** (no attachment to bad ideas)
4. **Learn and repeat** (every failure teaches something)

Most startups spend months perfecting one idea. We test multiple ideas and find winners faster.

---

## Try It Yourself

```bash
# Setup (one time)
git clone https://github.com/albeorla/founder-mode.git
cd founder-mode
cp .env.example .env   # Add your API keys

# Run
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm app run "Your business idea here"
```

In a few minutes, you'll have a professional investment memo for your idea.

---

## TL;DR

**Founder-Mode** = AI that does business research for you

- Input: A business idea in one sentence
- Output: A professional investment report
- Time: Minutes instead of weeks

**For developers**: It's also a toolkit for building AI apps fast by sharing 80% of the code between projects.

**The philosophy**: Test ideas quickly, fail cheaply, find winners faster.
