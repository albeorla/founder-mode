# Project Plan - Phase 2: Strategic Pivot

This plan covers the documentation updates required to align the project with the new "Deal-Screener" vision.

## Phase 1: Product Vision
Goal: Update the core product documentation.

- [x] **Task: Update product.md**
  - Rewrite `conductor/product.md` to feature "Deal-Screener" as the flagship product.
  - Incorporate the "24/7 PE Associate" concept and the "Data Moat" strategy.
  - Define `founder-mode` as the engine/platform.
- [x] **Task: Review product-guidelines.md**
  - Ensure the tone/voice guidelines support the "Adversarial Critic" needed for PE diligence.
- [x] **Task: Update tech-stack.md**
  - Add upcoming requirements for "Data Room Connectors" (Intralinks/Datasite integrations) and "PDF/Excel Processing".

## Phase 2: Roadmap Alignment
Goal: Ensure future planning docs reflect the pivot.

- [x] **Task: Verify tracks.md**
  - (Already partially done) Ensure the roadmap in `tracks.md` flows logically from this pivot.
- [x] **Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification** (Protocol in workflow.md)
