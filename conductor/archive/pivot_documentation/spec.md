# Track Spec: Strategic Pivot - Documentation & Vision Alignment

## Overview
The project is pivoting from a general idea validation studio to a specialized "Private Equity M&A Diligence" product codenamed **"Deal-Screener"**. This track focuses on updating the project's documentation (`product.md`, `tech-stack.md`, etc.) to align with this new vision.

## Objectives
- Redefine the product vision in `conductor/product.md`.
- Articulate the "Deal-Screener" value proposition: "The 24/7 PE Associate".
- Highlight the "Data Moat" (Data Rooms vs. Public Search) and the "Critic Advantage".
- Define the role of `founder-mode` as the underlying *engine* rather than the sole product.
- Outline the technical requirements for the new direction (PDF processing, Data Room connectors).

## Inputs
- **Concept:** "The 24/7 PE Associate".
- **Input:** Data Room URL (PDFs, Excel, contracts).
- **Action:** Cyclic Multi-Agent Graph (Scanner -> Analyst -> Critic).
- **Output:** Red Flag Report & IC Memo.
- **Moat:** Private Data + Adversarial Critic.

## Scope
- `conductor/product.md`: Complete rewrite/heavy edit.
- `conductor/product-guidelines.md`: Review for alignment (tone might remain similar: "Professional, Adversarial").
- `conductor/tech-stack.md`: Update to include future requirements (PDF parsing, etc.).
