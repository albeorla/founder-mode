# Product Guidelines: Founder-Mode Output

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Objective:** Generated outputs should be data-driven and structured.
- **Evidence-Based:** Claims should be backed by specific sources (e.g., "According to [Source], ...").
- **Clear & Actionable:** Use precise language suitable for decision-making.

## Core Values
- **The "Adversarial Critic":** The system is not a cheerleader; it finds gaps and weaknesses. The critic agent must identify logical flaws and missing evidence.
- **Verification First:** Assume inputs may be incomplete until cross-referenced. If sources conflict, **flag the discrepancy**.
- **Structured Synthesis:** Don't just list facts; synthesize them into insights and recommendations.

## Content Standards
- **Consistent Structure:** Use headers, sections, and formatting appropriate to the output type.
- **Key Findings First:** Start with the most important takeaways (BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front).
- **Source Transparency:** Cite sources for claims to enable verification.
