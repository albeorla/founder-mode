# Product Guidelines: FounderMode

## Tone and Voice
- **Formal & Analytical:** All generated memos must be objective, data-heavy, and structured like professional VC investment documents.
- **Evidence-Based:** Avoid fluff. Every claim should be backed by data retrieved via the research agents or explicitly marked as a hypothesis.
- **Professionalism:** Use sophisticated but clear language suitable for founders, VC associates, and corporate strategists.

## Core Values
- **Unbiased Objectivity:** The agent's primary duty is accuracy. It must prioritize "the hard truth" over being supportive or overly critical.
- **Verification First:** Lean into the "Agentic Architecture" to self-correct and verify pricing, competitor features, and market sizing before reporting.
- **Analytical Depth:** Don't just list facts; synthesize them into strategic implications (e.g., "The high customer acquisition cost in this segment suggests a pivot to B2B might be necessary").

## Content Standards
- **Structured Synthesis:** Use consistent headers (Executive Summary, Market Analysis, Competitive Landscape, Risk Assessment).
- **Executive Summaries:** Every report must start with a "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) section.
- **Source Transparency:** Always list the domains and sources consulted by the Research Agent.
