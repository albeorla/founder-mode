# Path to Profitability: Due Diligence Arbiter

**Target:** Ramen profitability ($4-5K MRR) in 6-8 weeks
**Method:** High-value B2B sales to search funds and independent sponsors

---

## Financial Target

### Ramen Profitability Definition

| Cost Category | Monthly Amount |
|---------------|----------------|
| Rent (shared/cheap) | $1,500-2,000 |
| Food | $500-600 |
| Health insurance | $400-500 |
| Utilities/phone/internet | $200-300 |
| Buffer | $400-600 |
| **Total** | **$4,000-5,000** |

---

## Revenue Model

### Pricing Options

| Model | Price | Deals/Month Needed | Pros | Cons |
|-------|-------|-------------------|------|------|
| Per-deal | $750 | 6 | Low commitment | Unpredictable |
| Monthly | $1,500 | 3 | Predictable | Higher commitment |
| Quarterly | $4,000 | 1.5 | Best retention | Harder initial sell |

### Recommended Initial Pricing

**$1,500/month** (or $750/deal with 2+ deal minimum)

Rationale:
- Search funds review 50-100 deals; $1,500/month for all is a no-brainer
- Per-deal pricing creates friction ("should I use it on this one?")
- Monthly creates stickiness
